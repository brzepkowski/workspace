    "2. The first beam splitter transforms the state of the photon by applying the Hadamard ($H$) gate, resulting in the state \n",
    "$$ H\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle =  \\frac{\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n",
    "3. The second beam splitter applies the $H$ gate again, and the state becomes (using linearity of quantum gates)\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "H \\frac{\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} H \\left| 0 \\right \\rangle+  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} H \\left| 1 \\right \\rangle \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle + \\left| 1 \\right \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle - \\left| 1 \\right \\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\\\\n",

    "where in the calculation above we used the linearity of quantum gates. What this means is that when the photon hits the second beam splitter it will always be *reflected*, and thus it will hit detector A. As you can see from the last calculation, the amplitudes corresponding to $\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle$ terms have interfered *constructively*, while the amplitudes corresponding to $\\left| 1 \\right \\rangle$ terms have interfered *destructively*. You could interpret this as the photon having \"interfered with itself\". (A similar effect explains the interference patterns that we saw in the double-slit experiment of the previous module. Now you have a better understanding of that phenomenon too!). So what is happening to the photon as it goes through the circuit looks something more like this:\n",
