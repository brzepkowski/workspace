No current flowing through the wire represented the state 0, while current flowing through it represented the state 1. In a quantum circuit, one can intuitively think of the wire as carrying a photon. The convention in quantum computing is that the qubits are always initialized in the state $\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle$.\n",

    "The quantum information carried by a wire is manipulated by quantum gates, which you encountered in the previous module, and of which you have seen several examples.

For learning purposes, and since we will be dealing mostly with very small quantum circuits, we will be performing a classical simulation of the quantum circuits we build. Running these programs on an actual quantum computer will be as simple as changing one argument in our code. \n",

    "As you build more intuition, we would like you to sometimes pause and reflect deeply about the understanding you are developing. For example, there is a good chance that you have heard of *Schrodinger's cat*, a famous thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrodinger during the early development of quantum theory. At this time, scientists were just beginning to discover the strange and counterintuitive concepts behind the quantum world. They often used thought experiments to investigate and explain these surprising ideas. In this thought experiment, a cat is put in a box, and there is a mechanism to kill it (why would someone do that? It baffles us too!). That mechanism is triggered by the decay of a radioactive atom. Now, the state of a radioactive atom is in superposition of having decayed and not decayed. This is just like the state of the qubit, where 0 could be 'not decay' and 1 could be 'decay'. Does this mean that the cat is in a superposition of being 'dead' and 'alive'?\n",

    "You see, even with single qubits, you can think of some 'interesting' experiments, if you just figure out a way to couple the output from a qubit measurement to some macroscopic event.\n",

    "<font size=3 color=b64c35>**Problem 1.**</font> Consider the firework thought experiment described in the last section of Module 5. Recall that there were three cases:\n",
    "1. There was no firework placed in the system.\n",
    "2. The firework was placed in the lower path, and exploded upon being hit by the photon.\n",
    "3. The firework was placed in the lower path, and the photon \"chose\" the opposite path, leaving the firework unexploded.\n",

    "- The beam splitter acts as a Hadamard ($H$) gate.\n",

    "Recall that when the firework is placed in the lower path, it forces a measurement, causing the photon to collapse to either  $\\left| 0 \\right>$ or  $\\left| 1 \\right>$ before it reaches the second beam-splitter. When you simulate scenarios 2 and 3, you should break the simulation into two parts:\n",
    "- First perform the measurement to determine whether the photon took the higher or lower path.\n",
