But in the world of complex numbers, negative numbers have square roots as well! As far-fetched as this may seem, it turns out that such a number system finds many applications throughout mathematics. You shouldn't think of complex numbers as an absurd idea just because it does not align with physical intuition. Pure mathematics often studies abstract concepts that do not necessarily have any direct connection with the real world, but nonetheless these concepts are well-defined and interesting in their own right!

So, if you wanted to plot the complex number $c_1 = 6+4i$, you would use point $p_1 = (6,4)$. Similarly, the complex number $c_2 = 2+2i$ would be the point $p_2 = (2,2)$. This is particularly useful, because complex numbers add just like points in the plane! As you can see in the gif below, the real components add together, and so do the imaginary components, each separately; if you add six \"$1$\"s and four \"$i$\"s to two \"$1$\"s and two \"$i$\"s, of course you end up with eight \"$1$\"s and six \"$i$\"s:\n",
