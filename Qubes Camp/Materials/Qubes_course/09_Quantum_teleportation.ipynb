    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a protocol for transporting quantum states from place to another across any distance, whether across a room or across the galaxy. This is a particularly fun one to think about, as it displays many of the surprising features of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, despite what some headlines might suggest, the story is not as simple as faster-than-light communication, as we will soon see. Let's begin with a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two people, Alice and Bob, living happily on earth until space war breaks out, forcing Alice to leave for a mission on Proxima Centauri-B while Bob remains on Earth. As a symbol of their shared bond, they decide to make a Bell pair of qubits, and each holds onto one of them. The two qubits shall remain carefully entangled in this state. While on her mission, Alice discovers a qubit in enemy territory. The exact superposition state of this qubit is what enemies use as a password for some important information stored in a quantum memory machine. One of these machines was captured in the previous missions and is currently being studied on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this password qubit in possession, standing alone in a quantum lab of the enemy, Alice realizes that she will be captured soon and needs to send the qubit/information in the qubit back to Bob on\n",
    "Earth. The big question is, how can she send either the qubit itself/the information in the qubit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want you to appreciate the following aspects of the mission at hand:\n",
    "1. As we have learned, she cannot just measure the information and send it to Bob, because, as we have learned, measuring the qubit collapses the state of the qubit to one of the possible standard basis states. Let's say the state of the qubit was:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle=\\alpha \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle+\\beta \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle \\end{align} \\label{general_state}\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " If Alice measures it, she will measure the qubit to be in $\\left| 0 \\right \\rangle$ or in $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$, and she would have no idea what the superposition defined by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ was.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. She also cannot just beam the qubit through space. A quantum state is very fragile: if the qubit interacts with anything on its way, the quantum information would be destroyed. With Earth being light years away, the latter would happen with overwhelming probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what can she do? \n",
    "Remember that Bell pair that Alice and Bob shared. Alice and Bob will be able to use their entangled pair of qubits to communicate this superposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice entangles her Bell pair qubit with the password qubit.\n",
    "- Alice then measures both the qubits in possession, which will affect the state of Bob's qubit. The states of the qubits upon measurement will be one of the following options: 00, 01, 10, 11.\n",
    "- She then beams her measurement results back to earth and based on the measurement, Bob applies some quantum gates to his qubit (depending on the received measurement results), upon which he will recover the state of the qubit that Alice intended to send.\n",

What is useful about the quantum teleportation protocol is not that the state of a qubit instantly zips from one place to another (although that's certainly amazing!) but that after this protocol we have recreated any arbitrary exact superposition state without ever destroying it by careless measurement!"

    "The circuit to perform quantum teleportation consists of two subcircuits:\n",
    "- the two-qubit circuit Alice performs on the password qubit and on her half of the Bell state pair.\n",
    "- the circuit that Bob performs to retrieve the state of the original the password qubit, based on Alice's measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, quantum teleportation does not allow Alice and Bob to communicate faster than the speed of light. Alice still has to send Bob *classical* information about her measurement outcomes, which definitely can't travel faster than the speed of light, in order for Bob to know what correction to apply on his side and be sure he's in possession of the correct state."
