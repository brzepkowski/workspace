Using this `transpile` function is the goal of this tutorial.\n",

    "`ibmq_16_melbourne` represents a problem.  There is no qubit anywhere that is connected to four others via CNOT gates.  In order to implement a CNOT gate between qubits that are not directly connected, one or more SWAP gates must be inserted into the circuit to move the qubit states around until they are adjacent on the device gate map.  Our choice of `initial_layout` in `job3` above was purposely designed to take many SWAP gates to make adjacent. As we have seen previously, each SWAP gate is decomposed into three CNOT gates on the IBM Q devices, and represents an expensive and noisy operation to perform.  Thus, finding the minimum number of SWAP gates needed to map a circuit onto a given device, is an important step (if not the most important) in the whole execution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many important things in life, finding the optimal SWAP mapping is hard.  In fact it is in a class of problems called NP-Hard, and is thus prohibitively expensive to compute for all but the smallest quantum devices and input circuits.  To get around this, by default Qiskit uses a stochastic heuristic algorithm called `StochasticSwap` to compute a good, but not necessarily minimal SWAP count.  The use of a stochastic method means the circuits generated by `transpile` (or `execute` that calls `transpile` internally) are not guaranteed to be the same over repeated runs.  Indeed, running the same circuit repeatedly will in general result in a distribution of circuit depths and gate counts at the output.\n",
