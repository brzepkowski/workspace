It takes a list of strings use to label each execution's results. This is mostly useful when plotting multiple execution results in the same histogram. The `sort` kwarg is used to adjust the order the bars in the histogram are rendered. It can be set to either ascending order with `asc` or descending order with `dsc`. The `number_to_keep` kwarg takes an integer for the number of terms to show, the rest are grouped together in a single bar called rest. You can adjust the color of the bars with the `color` kwarg which either takes a string or a list of strings for the colors to use for the bars for each execution. You can adjust whether labels are printed above the bars or not with the `bar_labels` kwarg. The last option available is the `figsize` kwarg which takes a tuple of the size in inches to make the output figure."
